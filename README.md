# SparkFun RGB LED Push Encoder pHAT for Raspberry Pi (encoderphat)

## What is it?
It's an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi single board computer.

It makes use of 3x AVR Microcontrollers working together across I2C.

## What does it do?
It adds 3x customisable knobs with built-in multicoloured lights and push buttons.

It also gives you better access to the Pi's SPI Header Pins and lets you add custom firmware.

## Why do I need one?
It's great for small projects which need analog control, especially for music and science projects.

It can also combine with other HATs to form a keyboard scroller for when a USB keyboard is impractical.

## How do I get one?
It hasn't been released yet at the time of writing. I hope that SparkFun may pick it up and start producing it.

For now, these are my EAGLE design files. You may fork this repository and customise the design before you send it to The Fab.
